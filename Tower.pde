//A Tower is the player's main defense against the mobs.
//Towers are placed on the maps and then automatically
//act. There are 3 kinds of towers (but you can make more!)

//Gun Tower: These towers shoot bullets that fly across
//           the screen and do damage to mobs.

//AoE Tower: These towers place AoE_Rings that deal damage
//           to all mobs in the ring.

//Sniper Tower: These towers automatically target the first
//              mob no matter where they are on the scren.
